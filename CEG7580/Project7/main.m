% Problem 1: Salt & Pepper Noise Generation/Median Filter based Noise Reduction
% (a) Add salt-pepper noise to Fig. 5.7(a) from text with Pa=Pb= 0.2
%     eqn. (5-16) p(z) = { Pa       ;  for z = 2^(k)-1
%                        { Pb       ;  for z = 0
%                        { 1-(Pa+Pb);  for z = V


% (b) Apply median filtering block (3x3) to new image.

% (c) Apply two more passes of median filtering and display results

% (d) Explain any major differences

% Problem 2: Periodic Noise Reduction Using a Notch Filter
% (a) Remove sinusoidal interference in frequency domain from astronaut.tif

% (b) Display and compare to original image
